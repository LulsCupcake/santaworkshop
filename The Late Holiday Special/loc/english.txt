I've been on Santa's naughty list ever since we killed Bo, or maybe it was the other time we killed him. Either way, that means I'm not gonna get a sick bike for Christmas this year.
But you guys can fix that.

Switch is gonna drop you off at the North Pole. You're gonna sneak in, put me on the nice list, and steal that bike I wanted for good measure.
That'll show that dumb fuck Santa for trying to ruin my Christmas.
