But one day, I woke up in the middle of the night and saw that fat bastard peddling away on my bike! My fucking bike!
So, we're gonna get revenge on this asshole. Switch is gonna drive you over to the North Pole so you can break into his workshop and get my bike back.
Steal anything else that jolly fuck has in his vault while you're at it.
